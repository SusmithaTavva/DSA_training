Time Complexity conditions-->
  -> Ignore smaller
  -> Focus on Worst case
  -> Ignore Constants
to solve a problem we have 3 steps:
  1> write a code which contains 2 for loops
  2> run one more for loop
  3> write the code in constant time.
    if we analyze the code the time complexity will be n^2 for step1, n for step2, and 1 for step3
To get the time complexity for the code follow the conditions , so for the above steps the time complexity will be O(n^2).


BEST CASE                                    WORST CASE                             AVERAGE CASE
less time                                    more time                              average of best and worst


SPACE COMPLEXITY:
if we use extra space for solving the problem that extra space will be considered as space complexity.
