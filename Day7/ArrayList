-Array is having fixed size, once we declare we cant change(increaseor decrease).
-To increase array size dynamically we have to use ArrayList and it belongs to Collection framework
-- What is a frameWork?
      -- Frameworks are predefined methods and will guide the program
-- Syntax for ARRAYLIST:- List <Wraper class> ArrayListName = new ArrayList<>();
                    eg:- List <Integer> array = new ArrayList<>();
-- list is an interface, interface contains incomplete methods
-- Wrapper Class is not a primitive datatype its a class 
-- in collections we have to use wrapper class only.
-- <> are called generics
-- ArrayList<> is a class and it contains complete methods
-- in ArrayList - dynamic nature(if my arraysize is 2 , and if i try to add 3rd element , the size will be doubled, and it will copy previous elements and viceversa the array will become half if we delete an element)
eg -- [1,2] add(3)--> [1,2,3,_] , delete(3)--> [1,2]
-- As arraylist is a class we have to import Arraylist class ,so that we can access all the predefined methods which consists in arraylist.
