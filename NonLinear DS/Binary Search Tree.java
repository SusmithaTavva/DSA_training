BinarySearchTree:-
  the left value of the node should be lees than the root value and the root value of the node should be less than right node's value(left<Root<Right)
Adv: for BST if we print inorder traversal we get the output in sorted
Disadv: the tree might be skewed(all nodes have only child)

*Balenced Tree: height(left tree) - height (right tree) == -1, 0 , 1

*AVL : AVL tree is self balanced tree
  4 types:left-left
          right-right
          left-right
          right-left
we use AVL tree to make a BST balanced in worst case
