*Segment Tree: in an array if we want to get the sum of particular range values we use a simple for loop, but the time complxity will be O(n).
                 and we want to get the output in O(log n), So we have to use Segment tree or  binary search


if given a range to find their sum in an array then if we use for loop the time complexity will be O(n^2)
  so to reduce that we use segment trees in which we get O(log n)
