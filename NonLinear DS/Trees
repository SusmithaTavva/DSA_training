TREES-->
  Trees are acyclic graphs(doesnt have cycles)
-starting node -- Root Node 
    eventually every node is a root node
    whatever nodes that are added to root node are called child nodes
-Leaf Nodes  to travel from root node to last nodes we have 
    two ways of traversals: DFS
                              i) Inorder - left, root, right
                              ii) PreOrder - root, left, right
                              iii) PostOrder- left, right, root
                            BFS
                              i) LevelOrder

TREE CREATION-->
1) create a node which contains data as well as left and right pointer.

TYPES OF TREES-->
N-Array Tree( ex:Tries) - N nodes can be attached to a root node
Binary Tree - at most two child nodes can be added to the root node
 Ex: 1) binary search tree
      2) AVL tree & Red-Black tree
      3)Segment tree

height -- longest path of the tree
diameter --( height of left tree + height of right tree) + 1

*Perfect Binary Tree : every node should contain two child nodes , and every level should be filled
*Full Binary Tree: every node can have either 0 or 2 children , and every level should be filled.
*Complete Binary Tree: every level should be filled , and nodes should start left to right.
